Description: Collects Linux system configuration into a HTML and text file.  
 Config to HTML is the "swiss army knife" for the ASE, CE, sysadmin
 etc. I wrote it to get the nessary informations to plan an update,
 to performe basic trouble shooting or performance analysis.
 As a bonus cfg2html creates a nice HTML and plain ASCII documentation from
 Linux System, Cron and At, installed Hardware, installed Software,
 Filesystems, Dump- and Swapconfiguration, LVM, Network Settings, 
 Kernel, Systemenhancements and Applications, Subsystems.
