# cfg2html (Config to HTML)

## Overview

**cfg2html** is a little utility to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up to an ASCII file and HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful in disaster recovery situations.

## Purpose

cfg2html collects the system configuration into a HTML and a text file. cfg2html is the “Swiss army knife” for the sysadmins. It was written to get the necessary information to plan an update, to perform basic trouble shooting or performance analysis. As a bonus cfg2html creates a nice HTML and plain ASCII documentation from your System.

This include the collection of Cron and At, installed Hardware, installed Software, Filesystems, Dump- and Swap-configuration, LVM, Network Settings, Kernel, System enhancements and Applications, Subsystems.
